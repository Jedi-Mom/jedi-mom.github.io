## Description

A brief description of your project

This is a personal webpage, showcasing my Portfolio of photos, an About me page and a Contact page.  For the Porfolio page, I have created html and css coding to set up lightbox.  With the lightbox, the thumbnails are the before pictures and the lightbox pictures are the edited versions.

I created a contact form on my Contact page that will actually send emails to my designated email address.  **note** if doing this for the first time from a different computer, you may have to re-confirm my email --- Brian/mentor will need me to confirm so they can verify it works.  Once I confirm in my email, they will need to refesh the page to get the Almost there page to click "I am not a robot" and click on the link to go back to the contact page.
